        <h4>This is the generation that will decide whether the Internet is a tool for control, or a platform for innovation and freedom. We have an incredible opportunity. We can shape the next one and one hundred years of human connection.

        <p>In other words, BitTorrent is not what you think. But it's how the internet should think: people-powered and people-owned, in principle and practice.</p>
        <p>Your data belongs to you. You deserve options. And the Internet is above all else powered by people. Certain freedoms are hardcoded. It is up to us -- it's up to all of us -- to uphold them.</p>
