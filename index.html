        <h4>We put billboards up in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</h4> 

        <p>We wanted to remind the world what's at stake on the world wide web.</p>

        <p>As a society, we’ve chosen to accept data centralization: personal information as property of a powerful few. We’ve chosen to accept walled gardens of creativity: a lifetime of work (our life’s work) locked into digital stores that take 30% of the revenue and streaming services that pay pennies in royalties. We’ve chosen to accept surveillance culture: the right of security agencies to violate the Fourth Amendment; to see and store data as they see fit.</p>

        <p>But these things are just that.  They are choices.</p>

        <p>And these choices belong to us.</p>

        <p>This is the generation that will decide whether the Internet is a tool for control, or a platform for innovation and freedom. We have an incredible opportunity. We can shape the next one and one hundred years of human connection. A free, open Internet is a force for change, creativity; the backbone of a society where citizens are stakeholders, not data sets.</p>

        <h4>BitTorrent is built to preserve that Internet.</h4>

        <p>We're a company founded on a few simple core values. Uphold user privacy, and user control. Keep the web free, open; decentralized, and accessible to all. BitTorrent is a people-powered protocol: the architecture of code deployment fot he Internet's dominant applications. We're a company founded on a few simple core values. Uphold user privacy, and user control. Keep the web free, open; decentralized, and accessible to all. BitTorrent is a people-powered protocol: the architecture of code deployment for the Internet's dominant applications.</p>

        <p>In other words, BitTorrent is not what you think, but it is how the internet should think: people-powered and people-owned, in principle and practice.</p>

        <h4>Your data belongs to you.</h4> 

        <p>You deserve options. The Internet is, above all else, powered by people. Certain freedoms are hardcoded. It is up to us -- it is up to all of us -- to uphold them.</p>
